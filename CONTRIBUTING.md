## Branch Naming Convention

Always create a new branch for each issue. Never commit directly to main.

| Type          | Pattern                 | Example                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| New feature   | feat/short-desc         | feat/add-pagination        |
| Bug fix       | fix/short-desc          | fix/search-crash           |
| Documentation | docs/short-desc         | docs/add-contributing      |
| Refactor      | refactor/short-desc     | refactor/split-app-js      |
| Tests         | test/short-desc         | test/recommendation-unit   |
| CI / Tooling  | ci/short-desc           | ci/update-flake8           |

Always branch off a fresh main:

    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

---

## Commit Message Format

Follow Conventional Commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

Format:
    type: short summary in present tense, under 72 chars
    optional body — explain WHY, not WHAT
    optional footer — e.g. Resolves #123

Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, ci, chore

Good examples:
    feat: add pagination to product listing API
    fix: prevent search crash on empty query
    docs: enhance CONTRIBUTING.md with GSSoC guide
    refactor: split app.js into focused ES modules
    test: add unit tests for hybrid scoring logic

Rules:
- Use present tense — "add" not "added"
- No capital letter at the start of the summary
- No full stop at the end
- Always reference the issue: Resolves #123 in the commit body or PR

---

## How to Raise an Issue

1. Search first — check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use the correct template:
   - Bug Report — for something broken
   - Feature Request — for new functionality or improvements
3. Fill in all sections of the template fully
4. Add the most relevant label: type:bug / type:feature / type:docs
5. For GSSoC: wait for gssoc:approved label before starting any work
6. Comment "I'd like to work on this!" and wait to be assigned before starting
7. PRs submitted without prior assignment may be closed without review

---

## PR Submission Checklist

Before opening a PR, tick every box:

    [ ] I branched off a fresh main (not an old or stale branch)
    [ ] My branch name follows the naming convention above
    [ ] My commit messages follow the Conventional Commits format
    [ ] I linked the issue with Closes #issue-number in the PR body
    [ ] I filled in all PR template sections (What changed / Why / How to test)
    [ ] I tested my changes locally end-to-end
    [ ] No new PEP8 / flake8 errors (run: flake8 backend/ --max-line-length=79)
    [ ] No unrelated files modified
    [ ] No .env, pycache, node_modules, or .DS_Store committed
    [ ] No console.log() left in production JS (use console.warn/error only)

PR title format (must match Conventional Commits):

    feat: add pagination to product listing
    fix: resolve search crash on empty input
    docs: enhance CONTRIBUTING.md with GSSoC guide
    refactor: split frontend app.js into ES modules

IMPORTANT: Always use Closes #issue-number in your PR description.
Our bot reads this line to automatically copy the correct difficulty labels
(level:beginner, level:intermediate, level:advanced) from the issue to your PR.
Without it, your PR will not get level labels — and that affects your GSSoC leaderboard points!

### GSSoC Rules

- One contributor per issue — first person assigned gets it
- Respond to review comments within 48 hours or PR may be reassigned
- Do not submit multiple PRs for the same issue
- Do not copy code from other contributors open (unmerged) PRs
- Do not open a PR from your main branch — always use a feature branch

---

## Code Style

### Python — Backend

- Strictly follow PEP8 — CI runs flake8 and will fail your PR if violated
- Max line length: 79 characters
- Use type hints on all function signatures
- Write Google-style docstrings on all public functions

Good example:

    def get_recommendations(title: str, k: int = 10) -> list[dict]:
        """Return top-k hybrid recommendations for a product title.

        Args:
            title: Product title to base recommendations on.
            k: Number of recommendations to return.

        Returns:
            List of recommendation dicts containing score, title, category.
        """
        ...

### JavaScript — Frontend

- ES Modules only (import/export) — no CommonJS require()
- Follow the module structure from frontend/js/:
  - state.js — global state only
  - auth.js — auth logic only
  - search.js — search logic only
  - recommendations.js — recommendation logic only
  - ui.js — DOM helpers only
  - app.js — entry point / wiring only
- Always null-check DOM queries
- No inline styles — use CSS classes
- Escape all user-facing strings before DOM insertion

### General

- No commented-out dead code in PRs
- No console.log() left in production code
- No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials — use .env
