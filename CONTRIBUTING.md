## Before You Start

1. **Find an issue** — Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues) and look for ones labelled `gssoc:approved` + `good first issue` if you are a beginner.
2. **Comment to claim** — Comment `"I'd like to work on this"` on the issue and **wait for it to be assigned to you** before starting any code.
3. **Do not submit a PR for an unassigned issue** — it will be closed without review.

---

## Branch Naming

Use this format: `type/short-description`

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat/` | Adding a new feature |
| `fix/` | Fixing a bug |
| `docs/` | Documentation changes only |
| `test/` | Adding or updating tests |
| `refactor/` | Code cleanup with no feature/fix |
| `perf/` | Performance improvements |

Examples:
- `feat/add-streamlit-ui`
- `fix/cold-start-fallback`
- `docs/update-setup-guide`
- `test/unit-tests-content-model`

---

## Commit Message Format

```
type: short description (max 72 chars)
```

Examples:
```
feat: add configurable alpha/beta/gamma weights via CLI
fix: handle empty interaction_df in CollaborativeRecommender
docs: add Jupyter notebook demo for hybrid recommendations
test: add unit tests for bayesian_rating function
refactor: extract weight normalization into helper function
```

- Use **present tense** ("add" not "added")
- Keep it **short and clear**
- Reference the issue number if applicable: `fix: handle cold start (#12)`

## Pull Request Guidelines

Every PR description **must include**:

```
## What changed
<!-- Describe what you added/fixed/changed -->

## Why
<!-- Explain the problem this solves or feature this adds -->

## How to test
<!-- Step-by-step instructions to test your changes locally -->

## Screenshots (if UI change)
<!-- Add before/after screenshots or screen recording -->

## Related issue
Closes #<issue-number>
```

**Rules:**
- One issue per PR — don't bundle unrelated changes
- All code must be tested locally before submitting
- If the project has tests, update them to cover your change
- Respond to review comments within **48 hours** or the PR may be closed
- Do not merge your own PR — wait for a mentor/PA to review it

---

## Code Style

This project uses **Python** and follows **PEP8**.

```bash
# Check for PEP8 issues
pip install flake8
flake8 . --max-line-length=100

# Auto-format (optional but recommended)
pip install black
black .
```

Key rules:
- Use `snake_case` for variable and function names
- Use `PascalCase` for class names
- Keep functions small and focused — one responsibility per function
- Add docstrings to all classes and functions
- No hardcoded credentials — use `.env` file (see `.env.example`)

---

## Running the Project Locally

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your Supabase credentials in .env

# 3. Start the backend server
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 4. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

# 5. Run the smoke test (no Supabase needed for this)
python test_pipeline.py
```

## GSSoC Label Guide

For your PR to count on the GSSoC leaderboard, mentors will add these labels after review:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `gssoc:approved` | ✅ Required — PR counts toward leaderboard |
| `level:beginner` | 3 points |
| `level:intermediate` | 7 points |
| `level:advanced` | 10 points |
| `quality:clean` | Score multiplier for well-written code |
| `quality:exceptional` | Higher multiplier for outstanding contributions |
| `mentor:username` | Mentor who reviewed the PR |

**You do not add these labels yourself** — mentors add them upon review.
